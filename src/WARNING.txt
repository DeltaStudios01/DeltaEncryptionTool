================================================================

**Description:**
DeltaEncryption Tool is an application for encrypting and decrypting text files
using various algorithms and security phases. This tool allows users to protect 
their data with an optional password and layered encryption.

================================================================
**Important Warnings:**
- **Do not manually modify the contents of the `.enc` or `key.txt` files.**
  This may cause decryption to fail.
- **Loss of the `key.txt` file will make decryption impossible.**
  Ensure that you store this file securely.
- **The application is not responsible for any file loss or modification.**

================================================================
**Additional Information:**
- All encrypted files will be packaged in a `.zip` file for easier distribution.
- The key file (`key.txt`) must be included with the `.enc` file for the decryption process.
- Contact the developer if you encounter any bugs or issues with the application.
